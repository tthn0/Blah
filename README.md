    This repository contains the source code for The Ion's automatic facial detection + recognition bot named Spud! We created a real-time, automatic facial detection and recognition system. This fusion of web development, AI, and physical computing delivers an innovative solution for seamless member tracking. As soon as someone walks into the room, our bot will log that into our database, and we're able to see that through a user-friendly interface on our website!
